# When you win a coin toss, your capital is multiplied by (1 + 2f).
# Whenever you lose, your capital is multiplied by (1 - f).
# Thus the game's result is independent of the order of wins and losses;
# what matters is only the total numbers of each outcome.
# 
# Suppose you have n tosses and w wins. Then there are n - w losses.
# By the binomial theorem, this outcome happens (n choose w) times out of 2^n.
# Moreover, the final capital is 1 * (1 + 2f)^w * (1 - f)^(n - w).
# 
# Some parts of this algorithm use accurate computations:
# - Sum of binomial coefficients in bigint, for the probability.
# - Conversion of the probability bigint fraction to decimal string.
# Some parts are inaccurate or are based on heuristics:
# - Calculating the final capital using floating-point arithmetic,
#   for each bet proportion and number of wins+losses.
# - Sampling the continuous input interval of [0.0, 1.0]
#   to try to maximize the value of the function.
# Overall this solution is not provably mathematically correct.
