    Phil the confectioner is making a new batch of chocolate covered candy.
       Each candy centre is shaped like an ellipsoid of revolution defined by the
       equation: b^2x^2 + b^2y^2 + a^2z^2 = a^2b^2.

       Phil wants to know how much chocolate is needed to cover one candy centre
       with a uniform coat of chocolate one millimeter thick.

       If a=1 mm and b=1 mm, the amount of chocolate required is 28 Ï€ mm^3
                                                                 3

       If a=2 mm and b=1 mm, the amount of chocolate required is approximately
       60.35475635 mm^3.

       Find the amount of chocolate in mm^3 required if a=3 mm and b=1 mm. Give
       your answer as the number rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal
       point.
